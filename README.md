# SUSTAINABLE POWER GENERATION IN INDIA : LEVARAGING LSTMs AND XAI FOR ENHANCED EFFICIENCY
This project focuses on forecasting daily power generation in India using Multivariate LSTM models, integrating Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) for transparency and interpretability. The research aims to enhance efficiency, reliability, and decision-making in the power sector.

I.Project Overview - 
Dataset: Power generation data (2017-2022) from 182 stations.
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, LSTM, Explainable AI (XAI), SHAP, LIME,Causal Impact Analysis
Objective: Forecast power generation and analyze influential factors to optimze resouces in power sector.

II.Key Features : 
âœ” LSTM-based forecasting for short-term power generation trends.
âœ” Causal Impact Analysis to assess external factors (e.g., maintenance).
âœ” Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) to interpret model decisions.
âœ” Data Imputation (handling missing/zero values).

III.Results & Insights : 
âœ… Accurate 30-day forecasting for Maharashtra and Punjab power stations.
âœ… SHAP analysis identified key drivers of power fluctuations.
âœ… Causal Impact Analysis revealed the effect of maintenance events.
âœ… Provides a scalable approach for optimizing power generation strategies.

IV. Suggestions and Improvements:
1.Predictive Maintenance (AI/ML-based)
Use machine learning algorithms on sensor data (vibration, temperature, load) to predict failures before they happen.
Helps avoid unexpected breakdowns and reduce forced maintenance.

2.Implement Real-Time Monitoring
Use IoT sensors and AI analytics to monitor equipment health continuously and detect early signs of failure.

3.Address Excess/Shortfall Issues
Analyze causes of frequent excess or shortfall in generation and adjust operational strategies accordingly.
Implement buffer capacity or backup systems to handle shortfalls smoothly.

This research contributes to sustainable energy planning and data-driven decision-making in the power sector. Contributions are welcome! ðŸš€
